SimianArmy 2.5.3 Mirror
-----------------------

This repo is a mirror of [Netflix Simian Army](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy) 2.5.3 war file.

This war file used to be distributed at https://dl.bintray.com/netflixoss/maven/com/netflix/simianarmy/simianarmy/2.5.3/simianarmy-2.5.3.war as per `Files` info on [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.netflix.simianarmy/simianarmy/2.5.3).
However, the war file no longer exists on Bintray since mid 2021, and Netflix/SimianArmy repo has been archived [noting](https://groups.google.com/g/simianarmy-users/c/-_LtRyhJQ0s) that parts of Simian Army project have been moved to be either a standalone project, replaced by another project, or embedded into another project.

So for those who can't yet move to the newer initiatives and still have to reply on Simian Army artifact, the mirrored file can be downloaded from https://github.com/shinesolutions-opensource/SimianArmy-2.5.3-mirror/blob/main/simianarmy-2.5.3.war .
